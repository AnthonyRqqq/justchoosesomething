## Description

Just Choose Something aims to allows people the freedom from decision paralysis! In our current version, we support a randomized choice picker that will select one option from a variety that it is given (or reinforce your choice if you only gave it one option). In the future, we plan to add multiple types of polling and the ability to select randomly from categories of past options.
